## About laravel-soccertables

  
These are the laravel files for the website @ 
[soccertables](http://laravel.ebob.uk/soccertables)
  
This site accurately displays football league tables throughout the league season for any date, including point deductions. Most sites (if not all) only show the league table for the end of the season, regardless of the date of the matches shown. The code can also sort tables accurately for league divisions that split at the end of the season (such as the Scottish Premiership).  

The site is an example of my skills in:
* php
* laravel
* mysql
